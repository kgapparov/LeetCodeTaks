Smallest Difference

Write the function that takes in two non empty arrays of integers, find the pair of numbers(one from each array) whos
absalute difference is minimum, you can assume that their only one pair of smallest difference:
Example:
arrayOne = [-1,5,10,20,28,3]
arrayTwo = [26,134,135,15,17]

Result:
output = [28, 26]
